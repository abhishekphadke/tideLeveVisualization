1. My selection was **Morgan point** as the first selection in addition to Nueces Bay

2. Created seperate folders for plots. Plots should be saved there everytime the ipynb is run.

3. I actually split Morgan into two ipynb. One considers data only for years 2010 to 2019. The exact timeframe for which we have Nueces bay data

4. The other ipyn considers the whole df- 1992 to 2019.
5. The whole df ipynb take a lot of time to run. 

6. Plots for 9 year as well as whole df, both are included in the accompanying report
